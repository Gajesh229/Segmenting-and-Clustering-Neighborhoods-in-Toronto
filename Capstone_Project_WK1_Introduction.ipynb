    "<p> Etobicoke is one of the city in this area, which has a highly diversified population, which totalled 365,143 in 2016. Out of that number more than 13% of people are from South Asia which means that the demand of their choice of foods and other items would be higher too! </p>\n",
    "<p> In addition to these, Etobicoke is very near to the Pearson Airport (Biggest & busiest airport in Canada), Humber College (One of top colleges in Ontario for international students), The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Temple (Religious place for Hindu community) and several other religious places (Gurudwara, Mosques, Temples) </p>"

He has been living in Etobicoke since then but his problem is that since he came here to now, he couldn't find the one stop place where he can eat local Indian food, shop Indian groceries or other things such as buy sweets. He is a business man who wants to help other people, not just Indian, but the people from the neighbour countries such as Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka who are homesick or who can find themselves at home and find things they want from one place </p>\n",
    "<p> Jay is looking for help from someone who can help him to decide where he can open this plaza. He wants this place to be located at very convenient location for everybody. </p>"

These clusters can be analyzed to help Jay to make his decision</p>\n",
